Deep Learning


The goal of this project is to study and improve different
Convolutional Neural Network models of image
classification. The balanced dataset comes from TensorFlow1 and contains the following classes:
'dandelion', 'tulips', 'sunflowers', 'roses' and 'daisy'.
It started with the creation of a model made from
scratch and then proceeded to the implementation of
several pre-trained models.

Finally, we assess the performance of our best model
using different evaluation metrics.
